# Future Features and Improvements TO-DO

This file lists features and improvements identified during the comparison with the initial project brief. These items can be tackled as separate features.

- [ ] **Complete .zip File Upload Functionality:** Finalize the backend processing for CVs uploaded within .zip archives to ensure this feature is fully operational and integrated with the LLM analysis pipeline.

- [ ] **Enhance Queue Management (Optional but Recommended for Scale):** Evaluate and potentially implement a more robust background task queue system (e.g., using Celery with Redis or RabbitMQ) for improved scalability and handling of multiple concurrent users or large batch uploads.

- [ ] **Implement User Accounts & Persistent Sessions:** Develop functionality for user accounts, login/logout, and persistent user sessions. This would allow users to save their analysis history, manage their JDs/CVs over time, and provide a more personalized experience.

- [ ] **Verify and Refine Frontend Responsiveness:** Conduct thorough testing of the web interface on various devices (desktops, tablets, mobiles) and browsers. Make necessary CSS adjustments and potentially refactor components to ensure a consistent and user-friendly experience across all platforms.

- [ ] **Add Download/Share Results Functionality:** Implement features that allow users to download the analysis results (e.g., as a CSV report, PDF summary, or individual CV analysis files) and/or share them (e.g., via a unique link or by exporting data).
